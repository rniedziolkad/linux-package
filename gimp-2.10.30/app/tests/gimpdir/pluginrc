The sample colors are sorted by brightness (== intentisty) and amount and stored in a sample colortable (where brightness is the index) The pixels of the destination layer are remapped with the help of the sample colortable. If use_subcolors is TRUE, the remapping process uses all sample colors of the corresponding brightness-intensity and distributes the subcolors according to their amount in the sample (If the sample has 5 green, 3 yellow, and 1 red pixel of the  intensity value 105, the destination pixels at intensity value 105 are randomly painted in green, yellow and red in a relation of 5:3:1 If use_subcolors is FALSE only one sample color per intensity is used. (green will be used in this example) The brightness intensity value is transformed at the remapping process according to the levels: out_lo, out_hi, in_lo, in_high and gamma The in_low / in_high levels specify an initial mapping of the intensity. The gamma value determines how intensities are interpolated between the in_lo and in_high levels. A gamma value of 1.0 results in linear interpolation. Higher gamma values results in more high-level intensities Lower gamma values results in more low-level intensities The out_low/out_high levels constrain the resulting intensity index The intensity index is used to pick the corresponding color in the sample colortable. If hold_inten is FALSE the picked color is used 1:1 as resulting remap_color. If hold_inten is TRUE The brightness of the picked color is adjusted back to the origial intensity value (only hue and saturation are taken from the picked sample color) (or to the input level, if orig_inten is set FALSE) Works on both Grayscale and RGB image with/without alpha channel.

The idea behind this filter is to give the look of a photocopied version of the image, with toner transferred based on the relative darkness of a particular region. This is achieved by darkening areas of the image which are measured to be darker than a neighborhood average and setting other pixels to white. In this way, sufficiently large shifts in intensity are darkened to black. The rate at which they are darkened to black is determined by the second pct_black parameter. The mask_radius parameter controls the size of the pixel neighborhood over which the average intensity is computed and then compared to each pixel in the neighborhood to decide whether or not to darken it to black. Large values for mask_radius result in very thick black areas bordering the regions of white and much less detail for black areas everywhere including inside regions of color. Small values result in less toner overall and more detail everywhere. Small values for the pct_black make the blend from the white regions to the black border lines smoother and the toner regions themselves thinner and less noticeable; larger values achieve the opposite effect."

The upper and lower edges are bent in shape of 2 spline curves. both (upper and lower) curves are determined by upto 17 points or by 256 Y-Values if curve_type == 1 (freehand mode) If rotation is not 0, the layer is rotated before and rotated back after the bend operation.

The idea behind this filter is to give the look of a black felt pen drawing subsequently shaded with color. This is achieved by darkening areas of the image which are measured to be darker than a neighborhood average. In this way, sufficiently large shifts in intensity are darkened to black. The rate at which they are darkened to black is determined by the second pct_black parameter. The mask_radius parameter controls the size of the pixel neighborhood over which the average intensity is computed and then compared to each pixel in the neighborhood to decide whether or not to darken it to black. Large values for mask_radius result in very thick black areas bordering the shaded regions of color and much less detail for black areas everywhere including inside regions of color. Small values result in more subtle pen strokes and detail everywhere. Small values for the pct_black make the blend from the color regions to the black border lines smoother and the lines themselves thinner and less noticeable; larger values achieve the opposite effect."
